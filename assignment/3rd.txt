-- Step 1: Create the tables
CREATE TABLE Users (
    UserID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    UserName VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE TeamMembers (
    MemberID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    UserID INT NOT NULL,
    TeamID INT NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (UserID) REFERENCES Users(UserID)
);

CREATE TABLE Teams (
    TeamID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    TeamName VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    ProjectID INT NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE Projects (
    ProjectID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    ProjectName VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    Deadline DATE NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE Tasks (
    TaskID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    TaskName VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    AssignedTo INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (AssignedTo) REFERENCES Users(UserID)
);

-- Step 2: Insert sample data
-- Insert into Users table
INSERT INTO Users (UserName) VALUES 
('Alice'),
('Bob'),
('Charlie'),
('David'),
('Eve');

-- Insert into Projects table
INSERT INTO Projects (ProjectName, Deadline) VALUES 
('AI Research Project', '2024-09-15'),
('Blockchain Project', '2024-08-20'),
('Quantum Computing', '2024-10-01'),
('Cybersecurity Initiative', '2024-07-30');

-- Insert into Teams table
INSERT INTO Teams (TeamName, ProjectID) VALUES 
('Alpha', 1),
('Beta', 2),
('Gamma', 3),
('Delta', 4);

-- Insert into TeamMembers table
INSERT INTO TeamMembers (UserID, TeamID) VALUES 
(1, 1),
(2, 1),
(3, 2),
(4, 3),
(5, 4);

-- Insert into Tasks table
INSERT INTO Tasks (TaskName, AssignedTo) VALUES 
('Design Architecture', 1),
('Develop Algorithms', 2),
('Write Documentation', 3),
('Perform Testing', 4),
('Launch Product', 1),
('Debugging', NULL);

-- Step 3: Queries

-- Query 1: Select users who are part of projects with deadlines after '2024-09-01'
SELECT UserID, UserName
FROM Users
WHERE UserID IN (
    SELECT UserID
    FROM TeamMembers
    WHERE TeamID IN (
        SELECT TeamID
        FROM Teams
        WHERE ProjectID IN (
            SELECT ProjectID
            FROM Projects
            WHERE Deadline > '2024-09-01'
        )
    )
);

-- Query 2: Select users who are not part of any team
SELECT UserID, UserName
FROM Users
WHERE UserID NOT IN (
    SELECT UserID
    FROM TeamMembers
);

-- Query 3: Select tasks where AssignedTo matches at least one UserID from Users
SELECT TaskID, TaskName
FROM Tasks
WHERE AssignedTo IN (
    SELECT UserID
    FROM Users
);

-- Query 4: Select projects with deadlines earlier than all other project deadlines
SELECT ProjectName, Deadline
FROM Projects
WHERE Deadline < ALL (
    SELECT Deadline
    FROM Projects AS OtherProjects
    WHERE OtherProjects.ProjectID != Projects.ProjectID
);

-- Query 5: Select team names that appear only once
SELECT TeamName
FROM Teams
GROUP BY TeamName
HAVING COUNT(TeamName) = 1;

-- Query 6: Select tasks assigned to more than one user
SELECT TaskID, COUNT(AssignedTo) AS AssignedUsers
FROM Tasks
GROUP BY TaskID
HAVING COUNT(AssignedTo) > 1;

-- Query 7: Select tasks assigned to users who are part of the 'AI Research Project' team
SELECT TaskName
FROM Tasks
WHERE AssignedTo IN (
    SELECT UserID
    FROM TeamMembers
    WHERE TeamID IN (
        SELECT TeamID
        FROM Teams
        WHERE ProjectID = (
            SELECT ProjectID
            FROM Projects
            WHERE ProjectName = 'AI Research Project'
        )
    )
);
